Comment: 
 This is a hand-hacked vapi file originally produced from
 gnome-keyring.h.  At this point, it is its own preferred form for
 editing at least until vapigen and gnome-keyring.h expose the right
 things to make it possible to use directly from Vala.  Unfortunately,
 vapigen removes the copyright from headers it is producing.  The
 license from gnome-keyring.h is:
